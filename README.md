# TV 'Golden Era' Analysis

## Overview 
Television's "Golden Age" has left an indelible mark on the entertainment industry, ushering in an era of exceptional storytelling and groundbreaking content. This project delves into this captivating period, which began in 1999 with The Sopranos and continued to redefine television for years to come.

Through the lens of data analysis, we explore the correlation between ratings and the number of votes garnered by TV shows during this remarkable era. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing both movies and shows, we aim to uncover insights into viewer preferences and the impact of critical acclaim on audience engagement.

## Description
In this project, I'll be delving into the fascinating world of the entertainment industry, particularly focusing on television during what many consider to be its "Golden Age." It all began in 1999 with the groundbreaking release of The Sopranos, and the wave of exceptional television content hasn't stopped since.

## Objectives
My objective is to examine a dataset packed with information on various movies and TV shows. Specifically, I'm interested in understanding how the number of votes a title garners correlates with its ratings. The hypothesis driving this investigation is that during this illustrious "Golden Age," highly-rated TV shows tend to attract the most attention and therefore accumulate the most votes.

## Conclusion
The conducted research validates that during the "Golden Age" of television, highly-rated shows tend to accumulate the highest number of votes. Notably, while shows with a score of 4 garner more votes than those with scores 5 and 6, the top three score categories (7-9) boast the most substantial number of votes. It's worth noting that the analyzed data covers approximately 94% of the original dataset, instilling confidence in the reliability of our findings.
